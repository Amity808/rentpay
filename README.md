<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

RentPay transforms African rental markets by easing upfront annual rent burdens with secure MiniPay transactions and budget-friendly saving tools. #DigitalRenting #FinancialInclusion
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Built With

To give tenants a simple, safe, and comprehensive way to handle their rent and utilities, RentPay is designed as a decentralized application (dApp) that makes use of a number of 
different technologies. Among the major technologies employed in this project are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): utilised as the front-end foundation for creating the application's user interface. Server-side rendering, routing, and other functionality are provided by Next.js, which improves the application's performance and user experience.
- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/): Usedd for writing our smart contract
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): Front end library which our Next.js app is going to be built on
- [Tailwind CSS](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs): Used in the styling of the UI components. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first approach to CSS that makes it possible to quickly design and modify user interface elements.
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config): Selected as the platform for development where smart contracts are assembled, tested, and implemented. For Ethereum development, Hardhat provides an extensive toolkit with integrated testing and debugging help.
- [Viem](https://viem.sh/): Utilised to control Ethereum interactions within the application and wallet connections. Viem provides tools for managing Ethereum addresses, approving trades, and getting blockchain information.
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/): Utilised to communicate with the Ethereum network. A JavaScript package called ethers.js offers APIs for communicating with smart contracts, sending transactions, and retrieving blockchain data.
- [Rainbowkit-celo](https://github.com/celo-org/rainbowkit-celo): Employed in the creation of UI components. In order to expedite development and guarantee consistency in design, Rainbowkit offers a set of pre-designed components that are readily integrated into the application.
- [TypeChain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typechain): Generated TypeScript bindings for Ethereum smart contracts using this. In TypeScript projects, TypeChain helps to maintain type safety and offers auto-generated typings for interfacing with smart contracts.
  
These technologies work together smoothly to produce a decentralised application that is reliable and effective and satisfies RentPay users' needs.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Prerequisites

- Node: Make sure your computer has both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. The official Node.js website has them available for download and installation.
- Git (v2.38 or higher)
- Install an Ethereum wallet that works with it (like MetaMask), and make sure the account has enough money in it to run smart contracts and use the app.

## How to use Celo Composer

The easiest way to start with Celo Composer is using `@celo/celo-composer`. This CLI tool lets you quickly start building dApps on Celo for multiple frameworks, including React (with either react-celo or rainbowkit-celo), React Native (w/o Expo), Flutter, and Angular. To get started, just run the following command, and follow the steps:

```bash
npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
```

### Front-end framework

![Celo Composer select framework](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/cc_step_1.png?raw=true)

### Web3 library (for react-app)

![Celo Composer select framework](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/cc_step_2.png?raw=true)

### Smart contract framework

![Celo Composer tool selection](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/cc_step_3.png?raw=true)

### Subgraph

![Celo Composer subgraph support](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/cc_step_4.png?raw=true)

### Name your dApp

![Celo Composer dApp name](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/images/readme/cc_step_5.png?raw=true)

**_ðŸ”¥Voila, you have a dApp ready to go. Voila, you have a dApp ready to go. Start building your dApp on Celo._**

### Getting started

Once your custom dApp has been created, just install dependencies, either with `yarn` or `npm i`, and run the respective script from the `package.json` file.

Scalability and Performance:
Exploring solutions for optimizing performance and scalability, including layer 2 scaling solutions, gas fee optimizations, and network upgrades.
Security Enhancements:
To reduce security risks and safeguard user assets, new security measures should be put in place, audits should be carried out often, and best practices should be followed.

Community Engagement:
Establishing a vibrant community around RentPay through initiatives for adoption, instruction, and rewards in order to get input for future enhancements.
Through tackling these obstacles and adhering to the plan, RentPay hopes to establish itself as a preeminent decentralized platform for managing rent and utilities, offering users all around the world financial inclusion and empowerment.
